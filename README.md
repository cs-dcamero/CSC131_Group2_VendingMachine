To use, you will need to run "javac vendingdriver.java" from the command line in the appropriate folder to compile the program.
Then, run " java vendingdriver" to run the driver for the program. Also, make sure that JDK is installed on PC.

This program simulates 1 cycle of a vending machine. Meaning, all data from a single instance will be lost.

To retrieve a copy of vending machine sale, enter 7 at the prompt.
This give the user access to the admin menu.
From the admin menu, enter 1 to access the sale and save a .txt file of the vending maching statistics.
